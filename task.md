# AttendanceDash Pro — Task Brief

## PHASE 2 — DESKTOP SHELL & GLOBAL UX

Status: **COMPLETE** (13 Aug 2026) — see BLOCKED markers in `implementation_plan.md`

## Objective

Reproduce the desktop reference interface (compact top navigation, profile dropdown, Profile/Appearance/Feedback/Settings/Install modals) on the Next.js app using real application data — without faking functionality.

## Delivered

- [x] Desktop top navigation (TopNav) replacing the legacy sidebar; active route highlighted; route labels mapped to existing routes only
- [x] Authenticated user area (avatar + name) + Profile dropdown with Profile / Appearance / Install App / Send Feedback / Settings / Sign Out
- [x] Shared modal foundation (`ShellDialog`) — backdrop, focus, Escape, scroll lock, responsive width, dialog semantics, consistent header/close/spacing
- [x] Profile modal from real `/student/me` data (identity + academic context)
- [x] Appearance modal — Dark selected; Light/System explicitly disabled (BLOCKED: Phase 1 tokens are dark-locked)
- [x] Feedback modal — validation, loading, success, error, duplicate-submission guard; posts to `POST /api/v1/feedback` (BLOCKED: endpoint not implemented; error surfaced honestly, no fake success)
- [x] Settings modal — controls disabled + persistence notice (BLOCKED: no user-preferences backend)
- [x] Install App — beforeinstallprompt capture + standalone detection; explains missing PWA infra (BLOCKED: no manifest/service worker); no fake installed state
- [x] Sign Out via existing `AuthContext.logout()` (JWT removal + redirect), auth architecture untouched
- [x] Backend: `GET /student/me` extended with read-only academic context (additive contract change; no schema/DB/engine changes)

## Not in this phase

- Home / Track / Quiz Eligibility / Attendance / History / Events page content redesigns (dedicated phases)
- Events functionality (list/calendar, Upcoming/Today/Past, Add Event, persistence) — dedicated Events phase
- Mobile navigation — dedicated later phase (nav hidden below `md`)
- Program field, feedback persistence, settings persistence, Light/System themes, PWA infra — see BLOCKED markers in `implementation_plan.md`

## Validation

- `npx tsc --noEmit` — PASS
- Backend `py_compile` on changed files — PASS
